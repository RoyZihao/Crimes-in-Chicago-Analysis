# Crimes in Chicago Analysis
DS-GA 1007 Final Project

This repo presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) about the crimes data using Heat Map. This technique reveals
the aggregated crime locations and types over a certain period of time. Our first goal is to estimate when and where crimes will happen. The second goal in our project is to predict the type of a crime given the time and location that crime might happen so that special precaution could be implemented by the local government and police department.
